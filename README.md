# CyberSecurity-Home-Lab
This project is about how I created a home lab.
I installed virtual box and created an attack machine and a vulnerable machine to demo pen testing . Kali and Ubuntu were the instances I used. This project was used for me to better understand a linux OS and using common Kali tools such as wireshark and nmap.
With the installation of kali and ubuntu...within in virtual box, I had to allocate the oppropriate amount of resources (RAM and storage) so that it wouldn't slow down down my host machine
